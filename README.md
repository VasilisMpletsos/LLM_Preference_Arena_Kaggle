## 🚀 About This Project

This project is my experimentation & solution for the Kaggle Competition: [LLM Classification Finetuning](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-classification-finetuning/overview)

The competiotion challenges participants to predict which responses users will prefer in head-to-head battles between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). The dataset consists of real-world conversations from the Chatbot Arena, where users interact with two anonymous LLMs and select their preferred answer.

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict user preferences between competing chatbot responses. This task is closely related to building "reward models" or "preference models" in the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The competition highlights the importance of overcoming common biases such as position bias, verbosity bias, and self-enhancement bias, which can affect preference predictions.
